## Introduction

In today's world, managing home safety, energy efficiency and convenience can be challenging. Many homes lack an integrated system to automate daily tasks like adjusting lighting, monitoring air quality, detecting gas leaks and responding to environmental changes. This project introduces an IoT-powered smart home system that makes your living space safer, smarter and more efficient.

Traditional home management relies heavily on manual operation of lighting, ventilation and security systems. Homeowners must physically switch appliances on and off, monitor air quality through observation and rely on standalone smoke or gas detectors without centralized control. This fragmented approach often results in energy wastage, delayed hazard detection and overall inconvenience, making home management inefficient and at times, unsafe.

In contrast, the IoT-Powered Smart Home Automation System offers a modern, integrated solution to these challenges. It enables real-time monitoring, automation and remote control through IoT connectivity. By streamlining home management, the system improves safety, reduces energy consumption and simplifies daily tasks. This makes home operation more efficient, secure and convenient for homeowners.

## Overview

The IoT-Powered Smart Home Automation System is a sensor-driven, cloud-integrated solution designed to optimize energy efficiency, enhance safety and provide real-time remote monitoring for modern households. The system consists of a network of IoT-enabled sensors and actuators that continuously monitor environmental conditions and automate home functions based on real-time data analytics.

The system is structured around a central microcontroller (ARIES v3.0), which serves as the primary processing unit, collecting data from multiple sensors and executing automation commands. 

Key hardware components include:

‚úÖ **Motion and Light Sensors** ‚Äì Enable automated lighting and fan control based on occupancy and ambient lighting conditions. <br>
‚úÖ **Temperature and Humidity Sensors** ‚Äì Optimize ventilation and climate control. <br>
‚úÖ **Fire and Smoke Detectors** ‚Äì Detect leaks and fire hazards, triggering immediate safety alerts. <br>
‚úÖ **Air Quality Sensors** ‚Äì Monitor pollutants and adjust ventilation accordingly. <br>

To enable real-time data transfer and remote control, the system utilizes Thingspeak, a cloud-based IoT platform that facilitates intelligent automation of various smart home functions. A user-friendly web and mobile application, built using Thingspeak‚Äôs IoT framework and Hostinger, allows homeowners to monitor sensor data, control devices and receive instant alerts from anywhere.

In the event of a gas leak, fire or deteriorating air quality, the system immediately notifies homeowners via IOT based alerts and notifications. Additionally, automated safety measures, such as ventilation control, are activated to mitigate risks and ensure timely hazard prevention.

This seamless integration of hardware, cloud connectivity and automation enhances home security, energy efficiency and overall convenience.

## Goals and Objectives
üéØ Monitor environmental changes like air quality and respond accordingly. <br>
üéØ Automate lighting, fans and ventilation based on motion, light, temperature, and humidity. <br>
üéØ Detect gas leaks, fires, and poor air quality for early safety alerts.<br>
üéØ Send real-time notifications for critical events.<br>
üéØ Enable remote monitoring and control via IoT platforms.<br>
üéØ Help homeowners make informed decisions to reduce energy wastage and lower costs.<br>

## Application Video

### Fire Alarm

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d61cbf85-8a01-4065-b9d7-003ee2cd630d

```bash
üì¢ This video demonstrates the working and implementation of a fire detection system.

‚û§ The flame sensor is connected to the Aries v3.0 board to detect the presence of fire.

‚û§ The sensor continuously monitors for flames and sends real-time data to the Arduino.

‚û§ The Arduino receives the sensor data and processes it accordingly.

‚û§ The processed data is displayed in the Serial Monitor, allowing users to observe sensor readings.

‚û§ When the flame sensor detects fire, it triggers an alert mechanism.

‚û§ The buzzer is activated as an alarm to notify individuals of the imminent danger.
```

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7c87fcd-87e8-4e0f-b2f3-a0556c34ada8

```bash
üì¢ This video demonstrates the working and implementation of an automatic light control system using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor.

‚û§ The LDR module is connected to the Aries v3.0 board to detect changes in ambient light levels.

‚û§ The sensor continuously monitors the surrounding light intensity and sends real-time data to the Arduino.

‚û§ The Arduino processes the received data and displays the readings in the Serial Monitor.

‚û§ When the LDR detects darkness, it triggers the blue bulb, and the lights are automatically switched on.

‚û§ When natural daylight is detected, the system turns off the light bulb to conserve energy.

‚û§ To simulate darkness in this video, the LDR sensor is covered using a box, demonstrating how the system responds in low-light conditions.

### Ventilation

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e39206d-2036-4223-8251-fb5d98c39daa

```bash
üì¢ This video demonstrates the working and implementation of an air quality monitoring and automation system using the MQ-135 gas sensor.

‚û§ The MQ-135 gas sensor module is connected to the Aries v3.0 board to detect changes in air quality.

‚û§ The sensor continuously monitors the surrounding air and sends real-time data to the Arduino.

‚û§ The Arduino processes the received data and displays the air quality readings in the Serial Monitor.

‚û§ When the MQ-135 sensor detects poor air quality, it triggers the incandescent filament light bulb, turning the lights on as an alert mechanism.

‚û§ When good air quality is detected, the system turns off the light bulb.

‚û§ Ideally, the light bulb will be replaced with fans or other relevant loads that help improve air quality and ventilation.

‚û§ In this video, the light bulb is used temporarily to demonstrate the system‚Äôs functionality.

‚û§ The PIR sensor module is connected to the Aries v3.0 board to detect motion from living beings.

‚û§ The sensor continuously monitors the surroundings and sends real-time data to the Arduino.

‚û§ The Arduino processes the received data and displays the readings in the Serial Monitor.

‚û§ When the PIR sensor detects movement, it triggers the yellow bulb, and the lights are automatically switched on.
